---Under the Guidance of Mr, Sanyam Wadhwa Sir**
---I Have used 
@Selenium , 
@TestNG , 
@Maven ,
@EclipseIDE for Creating this project**
---Some Test Functionality are not executable Cause of Login as i Have used demo ID and Password just for testing but I have tested the Login Functionality Using My Flipkart registered Id and Password at that time it is working fine,But I can't share the same cause of Confidentiality
######---Also Tried to Implement Data Driven test Case as a package is Available there by the name of com.DataDrivenTests under the src/test/java 
We can run the program either from maventest
